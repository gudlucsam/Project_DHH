i'm here on youtube  great"
254,"here i teach different topics
sometimes vlog"
255,did you know that instagram i have too
256,the name is the same aslmeredith
257,so on instagram too you can find me there
258,i share a little bit different from here
259,"here on youtube the videos can be
short or long  doesn't matter"
260,on instagram the videos are short
261,"the feed tends to be short videos that teach
something specific and then the"
262,"good receptive practice  meaning i just
you know think about my life and sign"
263,"something but then you can watch and try
to understand"
264,"plus i have  well they're not closed
captions they're open captions "
265,"subtitles so i sign and then little at
the bottom is text or sometimes above"
266,"little text has the english so you can
watch and try to understand and then"
267,so that's the stories and then third
268,"instagram every friday i post 
fingerspelling friday challenge"
269,that means i fingerspell  it tends to be three words
270,"i'll fingerspell those three 
sometimes four or five"
271,i fingerspell the firsttime fast normal speed
272,so the fingers still blend together but slower
273,"and the third is a beginner pace
meaning it's more clear"
274,"the hand shapes are clearly articulated
and slowly"
275,"many times there's a fourth part
where i describe those words "
276,"why i picked them
where the names are from"
277,"and if the words have a sign
i'll teach the sign"
278,"so anyway if you didn't know that on instagram
you can find me and we can connect"
279,"here i'm going to show you an example
of a fingerspelling friday challenge are you ready"
280,"well that was fingerspelling friday

300,runout
301,run into or bump into someone
302,so it's a little different from the sign meet meet you meet them
303,"there's more emphasis on you know
it just happened run into someone"
304,to gain and build on something
305,"so the u handshape the dominant hand
 builds on the nondominant"
306,or run down  to feel run down
307,runny nose
308,the 4 handshape  nose is running

1891,summon vs pet
1892,okay one viewer named brian he suggested
1893,good similar signs summon and pet
1894,what's the difference
1895,summon versus pet
1896,summon
1897,you can also summon me
1898,if you want me to come to you  summon
1899,or they summon
1900,"you can change the sign's direction
depending on who and where"
1901,the general sign is summon
1902,summon
1903,it's different from the sign pet
1904,pet  that word can be signed either
1905,fingerspelled pet that's fine pet
1906,or the sign pet
1907,pet
1908,notice they look very similar summon pet
1909,the difference is the movement movement
1910,for more about the different parameters 
1911,"newsletter and i teach different
lessons and things tips for learning and"
1912,"you'll find it in that corner you can
tap or in the video's description"
1913,or simply go to aslmeredithcom
1914,so the point is that the signs are different
1915,summon verses pet the difference is movement
1916,"the handshape location orientation facial expression 
they're all similar"
1917,the movement is different
1918,summon is one movement summon
1919,pet has a double movement twice
1920,it's like you're petting an animal pet
1921,so one time is summon two times is pet
1922,"other questions signs that are similar 
that you find confusing"
